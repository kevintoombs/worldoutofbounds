            When travelling overseas, you are surrounded in a new environment, new people, and a new culture. Many travelers do not intend to be rude but when you have not done any research, there is a great chance that you will do something offensive unknowingly. Looking at an American point of view who is travelling overseas, so many little gestures that you would not think twice about can be offensive to others. In this case, the sole of your shoes in Middle Eastern countries. In Arab cultures showing the sole of your shoe to anyone is a deemed a huge insult. The reason why it is perceived as an insult is because the shoes are unclean. The sole of shoes is constantly on the ground and are linked with the foot, which is the lowest point of the human body and why it is considered lowly. Showing the sole of your shoe to an Arab is offensive, but from my experience and through communicating with others around the world, it is also considered impolite in other cultures, not just Islam. Therefore, you will see people take off their shoes when they enter a mosque or a home. Same as Asian cultures too, you will always have to remove your shoes when entering a home or a temple. In Arabic countries, you can use your shoes to offend someone. An example of this would be the incident with George Bush in 2008.

              In 2008 during a press conference, Bush who was the current president during this time had a shoe thrown at him along with a few insults by an Iraqi journalist. This was the start of a new era; the flying shoes. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president also had a similar encounter, he as well was almost struck by a flying shoe that was thrown from the crowd.  Another instance where they showcased the shoe as insult was when protesters in Iraq topped the statue of Saddam Hussein and everyone had their shoes in their hand and started hitting the monument with it. In the Arab and Muslim world, the shoe has now become political. Throwing your shoe is now a free speech tradition in middle eastern countries. The shoe has no religious significance to Islam, and there is no direct mention in the Quran about shoe throwing to demean your enemies.

             If you are thinking about visiting a Middle eastern country, then make sure your feet are planted firmly on the ground. Letâ€™s say you accidently did show the soles of your feet. What can you do? Well simply apologize, the person you might have offended understands that you might not have the knowledge and mean no harm, but it can be negative if you felt that you made someone uncomfortable and continued to show your soles. Believe me when I say that I used to be shocked when I see students put their legs up on the seat in front of them, while the teacher was teaching. No one else cared, but I assure you this would be disrespectful and you will be judged by the impoliteness of your behavior. When traveling anywhere, just be aware of the customs of that place and take the time on your flight to learn about the place you are visiting.

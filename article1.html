              What is menstruation? Menstruation is the proper word for a period, the lining of the uterus breaking down and exiting the body through the vagina. The menstruation cycle is the series of events relating to menstruation that happens every month. The lining of the uterus is formed, the egg is released, when fertilization doesn't occur the lining breaks down and you have your period, then the lining starts to form again. In the U.S., monthly period for women means reaching into your cabinet for a pad or tampon or even driving to nearby store to stock up on menstruation products. I remember being tapped on the shoulder in high school and hearing a friend whisper in my ear, ÒThereÕs blood on the back of your pants.Ó I knew immediately I had started my period and I was nervous because I was wearing light colored pants and a white sweater. My friend assured me that I could hide the stain with my sweater. She gave me a sanitary pad, and I was able to make it through the last hour or so of the school day. While the experience felt embarrassing to me, I was lucky to have a friend who cared enough to discreetly tell me. Even without a pad on me, I had immediate access to one. And I could handle the situation in a nearby bathroom with running toilets, clean water and private stalls. For other parts of the world for example many Middle Eastern countries, menstruation can be a huge obstacle because of the lack access to the proper resources, such as water and female hygienic products.

                Menstruation is a normal and healthy biological function that women everywhere experience, yet menstruation remains a taboo throughout the world. The Middle East is no exception. The Middle East society has a patriarchal structure and it is easy for menstruation to be viewed negatively. Religious views play a role in the perception that menstruation is dirty and unclean. Religions such as Islam, Hinduism, Christianity state that menstruating woman are unclean and that they should be segregated during this time. The Quarn states, "They will ask you about menstruation. Say, 'It is harmful, so keep away from women during it. Do not approach them until they are purified of it, when they are purified you may approach them as Allah has ordained." (Qur'an 2:222). There are even practices today were women are forced to live in sheds during menstruation. An 18 year old name Tulasi Shahi died after she was bitten by a snake while sleeping in a shed. This was because she was kicked out of her home for menstruating.

               Women lack knowledge about menstrual health, and by women not knowing the fundamentals about their own body it can affect their physical and mental health overall. In the Western part of the world, menstruation is still a taboo but less compared to Middle Eastern countries. Girls in the West receive an education about periods in school and from their mother and it gives them the knowledge in dealing with menstruation properly. While in the Middle East, girls do not have that making them experience scary and embarrassing experiences with periods.
               Using a pseudonym name, Huda a Syrian woman lives in Saqba where there is no clean water and where feminine products are rare to find also expensive. Huda who could not afford these hygiene products stared to use sanitary pads for periods, but she only uses one per day. By reusing these pads, it leads to vaginal and urinary tract problems even kidney pains. Many women and girls face this problem alongside Huda. There are not enough hygiene products to in Syria for women and add to the fact that there is no water only adds more stress for these women. When women do not have access to water, so they are able to clean themselves regularly or clean clothes that they use for their menstruation the right way then they risk infection.

                If you are in Dubai and are suffering from the extreme pain from your period. And that you feel that the hospital is the only solution to help you relieve the pain. Well, hospitals in Dubai no longer see that menstruation pain constitutes as a medical emergency. This rule was introduced by the Dubai government under the insurance law. Mona, a researcher in Dubai says, ÒMy period is pretty much the most painful thing in my life (and IÕve broken several bones and that was fine in comparison).Ó She also explains that she had to take a certain number days off work because the pain was unbearable and really hindered her ability to do anything. A lot of institutions see missing class or work because of periods is unacceptable and is not a legitimate excuse.

                So how do we change the negative perception of menstruation? The stigma surrounding menstruation affects women and girls across the world, especially those who live in poverty or communities with gender inequality issues. The first step is to provide sanitary products where it is easy accessible in developing countries. This will help women better practice menstrual hygiene and to bring awareness that it is normal for women to have these periodical cycles. Female hygienic products alone will help fight against the stigma on a surface level. To really change the bad perception of menstruation in any society is to liberate women, we need to stop body shaming and viewing periods as shameful. Menstruation needs to be taught alongside with sex education in classroom. Not only teaching it to girls only, but also boys. I think that is where it truly starts, if we educate boys and girls early on about menstruation and how it is normal and healthy, then girls growing up will not be ashamed of menstruation. One of the main thing that girls and women worry about the most is concealment. Constantly worrying on how to hide any signs to the public that they are menstruating.

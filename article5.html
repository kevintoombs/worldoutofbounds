              Gambling or “playing games of chance for money”, this is something that takes place all the time, all over the United States.  In America gambling is not seen as something that is taboo or particularly evil although gambling addictions can be very detrimental to a person’s health and their economic status.  In America there is even a wide variety of gambling from cards to board game to sports or even the lottery, something for every interest.  However, in other places of the world like the Middle East gambling is forbidden or severely restricted.   In the United Arab Empire (UAE) gambling is forbidden and there are very harsh punishments not only for the people running the gambling operations but also for the people who participate in them, the penalties can range from large fines as wells a lengthy duration in prison.

              <p>
                The reasons behind the banning of gambling is that the Middle East and its governments have close ties to the Islamic religion.  Islam forbids gambling and views it as a sin.  The Fourteenth Greater Sin to be more exact, “O you who believe! Intoxicants and (Maesir) games of chance and divining (azlam) by arrows are only an uncleanness, the Shaitan’s work; shun it therefore that you may be successful.” (Surah al-Mā’ida 5:90).  Because of the governments close relationship with the faith they strive to fallow the faiths rules one of which is to not participate in gambling thus causing its ban.  This is to respect Islamic beliefs and to not offend their god.
              </p>
              <p>
                The UAE has also recently passed laws against gambling online.  There can no longer be any sites that allow gambling to take place, to be ran or managed and, for any winnings/profits of gambling to be run through any website.  There are similar punishments for those who try to gamble online as those who do it in person.  This ban on online gambling applies to all games that have any sort of chance in it.
              </p>

                So, while we may see gambling as a hobby, and for some a professional career here in America it can be viewed quite differently in other areas of the world.  So, if you plan on taking a trip to the Middle East and gambling is a big thing in your life you should make sure to get it out of your system before going there, as you will have a hard time doing it while you are there and if you are able to, it could get you into a load of trouble.

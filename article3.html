            <p>
              Halal (حَلَال) widely refers to what is allowed within the Islamic religion and its literal translation is “lawful”. It’s most frequent application, in English, is to refer to meat prepared by Islamic ritual slaughter (Dhabīḥah ذَبِيْحَة). In Islam, the only food considered haraam is pork. Islam also forbids you from eating anything in the name of something other than God, but that is largely considered a religious aspect rather than a physical act, so we won’t focus on that! The Quran also explicitly allows the consumption of food that is lawful under Jewish or Christian preparation. However, in addition to those simple requirements, humans can also not consume intoxicants, alcohol explicitly, blood, or animals of the land killed in an unholy way. The unholy ways still relevant today are “...one killed by strangling, and one killed with blunt weapons, and one which died by falling, and that which was gored by the horns of some animal, and one eaten by a wild beast, except those whom you slaughter...”
            </p>
            <p>
              That last portion has two interesting outcomes. Almost all seafood is halal regardless of preparation, and, the primary method of humane slaughter throughout the world is disallowed. Every humane slaughterhouse uses bolt stunning, gas stunning, or electrical stunning all rendering the animal unconscious and unaware of pain before death. Because all three of those methods of humane slaughter also cause death or lead to death every time before the killing blow, with the follow up physical slaughter as more of a precaution and speed measure, all of those methods are haram.

              So, then, what is halal meat? How do the majority of Muslims eat their meat? The Department of Halal Certification under the Islamic Educational & Cultural Centre Ireland seems to have to most concise, collected, and consistent description of what halal slaughter means to most organizations and muslims.

              <li>
                Animals must be alive during slaughter

                  Low voltage shock may be applied to mitigate violence, but is frowned upon
              </li>
              <li>
                  The animal must be slaughtered with a single cut through the throat severing the windpipe, jugular veins and carotid arteries but not the spinal cord
              </li>
              <li>
                The slaughtering by must done by a Muslim man uttering “Bismillah Allahu Akbar. (In the Name of Allah; Allah is the Greatest.)”

            </ul>
              
            <p>
              Halal food and beverages account for about 30 percent of the global market and is rapidly growing because a large percentage of global consumers are upset if their food is not halal, and in markets where halal meat is frowned upon, it is not required to be labeled.

            </h3>

            <p>
              Muslims in the United States are still allowed to practice Dhabīḥah not because of a religious exemption, but because the United States specifically defines two methods of slaughter as humane.
            </p>
            
            <p>

              T. 7 Ch 48. U.S.C.A. § 1902
              (a) in the case of cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep, swine, and other livestock, all animals are rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot or an electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective, before being shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut; or
              
              (b) by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument and handling in connection with such slaughtering.
            </p><p>  
              PETA disagrees with the claim that Islamic ritual slaughter is humane, however. PETA released a blog post in 2009 that began with a simple sentence before showing a video. It read, “I’m going to be frank—after a minute and a half of GAIA’s latest undercover video footage from a halal slaughterhouse in Belgium, I had to stop watching.” After the video jump, the author makes a concise point that echos what most anti-ritual slaughter critics are saying “Animals killed halal (according to Islamic law) cannot be stunned before their throats are cut, which means that many animals—including the cow shown in this video—fight and gasp for their last breath, struggling to stand while the blood drains from their necks.”
            </p>
              
            <h3>  
              Acceptance in the Europe
            </h3>
              
            <p>
              The European Union requires animals to be stunned prior to slaughter but also allows for its member states to take exemption based on religious reasons. Halal meat is a controversial topic all over europe, with groups like the British Veterinary Association, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) opposing it.
            </p>
              
            <p>
                Countries that currently have bans on unstunned slaughters include Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Sweden is the only country that claims to have halal slaughterhouses in their country after the ban, however, their largest accreditation agency frowns upon all stunning, and only explicitly permits calming voltages. http://www.halalcertification.se/Islamguidens_halalcertifiering_Halal_Standard.pdf
            </p>
              
            <p>
              Just a few months ago “The environment committee of the Walloon region in Belgium voted last week to prohibit the slaughtering of unstunned animals, leading to a ban on Halal and Kosher meat. The Muslim community of Belgium said their religious council had already expressed their opposition to stunned slaughter and remained steadfast on the stance,” according to The Tribune. The law is set to go into effect in 2019 and Belgium will be the country with the largest percentage of Muslims (~24% in the capital, Brussels) to ban unstunned slaughtering, so it will be interesting to see what happens. 
            </p>
            
              https://tribune.com.pk/story/1404361/belgium-bans-halal-kosher-meat/
              
            <p>                  
              The British Halal Food Authority recognizes only three methods of humane slaughter allowed under Islam. The first is used for Chickens and called a water-bath stun. With this type of stunning, the chickens are partially paralyzed and never actually stunned. The second type of stunning is for medium size animals like sheep and is called an electric-tong stun where the animal is rendered immobile with an electric shock prior to slaughter, but for slaughter special consideration to under-shock is systematic because electrocution curdles the blood rendering it inedible. The third method, and the ending of the first two methods, is the act of Dhabīḥah desribed earlier. 

            <p>                  
              Oddly enough, the electric-tong stun is not required in the EU and all other halal food authorities I could find banned all types of stunning including those allowed by the BHFA. From my research is appears that while this is allowed by some British Muslim halal authorities, the act is still considered haram amongst muslims as a whole and forbidden in countries under Islamic Law. Both of those stunning methods are technically not stunning as defined by the USDA or the word stun (http://www.upc-online.org/slaughter/101608thedeath.html). However, it is important to remember that the law I cited earlier says animals do not have to be “rendered indispensable to pain” when submitted to Jewish or Islamic slaughter in the Unites States, and that the EU also has a provision allowing for Islamic and Jewish exemption to humane, unconscious, slaughter.
